Starts Off facing the Me Chest.
Requires;
    Inventory upgrade
    Inventory Controller
    ME Upgrade

Recommended;
    2x Solar Panel Upgrade

Note, the output chest has item conduit that pulls cells and puts them into the system that is supposed to contain them.
Requires 1 instance of each to set filters properly so that the cells go to the right spot.

Note: Would almost certainly work for extruder shapes and molds and such already as well (at least so long as the item to be inserted stacks. Perhaps even if it doesn't.. this is unknown)
