I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH LOGIT.IO IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM!
Other than being a current or former customer.

This file needs to be edited (quite heavy most likely) by you, the user.

However it provides a clear format for interfacing with the metrics logging site logit.io 
with their metrics system at least, which is all you should need for minecraft...

Above the import statements is the bare minimum of what you will want to configure.
below is logic for the upload that actually functions with the values from the configs. (the ones you set too)

I offer this code as is, without warranty or guarantee, and under the "CC Zero" Domain.
Its free. Do whatever.. except try to claim you own it.. because you don't. its public property.
You can however modify it, fork it (actually fork it, not just lazy clone), whatever... and that new code should be entirely yours.
Even if you re-used elements of my code.

If this really helped you and you feel like doing me a solid, give me an honorable mention in any dirivites.
This is, however, entirely optional.

Happy Coding!
