These are robot scripts for controlling the Space Miner Modules and Space Pump modules of the Space Elevator Multiblock.
Designed for the Gregtech New Horizons Modpack.

Normally, there is no way for a computer to set configurations on these modules. 
Meaning that for example, Using one Pump module to pump every fluid would be impossible without manually changing the configuration values yourself.

And there was much rejoicing throughout the land!
