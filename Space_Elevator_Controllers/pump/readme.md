# Setup

## Robot

Robots aren't found in NEI with any recipe.
They are made by placing an opencomputers `Computer Case` in an opencomputers `Electronics Assembler`

The Electronics Assembler can be powered by connecting to an ME system with AE2 Cable

Or use EU by connecting a **gt _CABLE_ or gt _WIRE_**. **NO TRANSFORMERS, BATTERY BUFFERS, OR ANYTHING ELSE!** although you might use want them upstream from assembler on the wire for actually providing power on the wire.

Yes the wire still needs power.
