# Setup

## Robot

Robots aren't found in NEI with any recipe.
They are made by placing an opencomputers `Computer Case` in an opencomputers `Electronics Assembler`

The Electronics Assembler can be powered by connecting to an ME system with AE2 Cable

Or use EU by connecting a **gt _CABLE_ or gt _WIRE_**. **NO TRANSFORMERS, BATTERY BUFFERS, OR ANYTHING ELSE!** although you might use want them upstream from assembler on the wire for actually providing power on the wire.

Yes the wire still needs power.

* **Redstone Card (Tier 2)**
* **Memory Module (Tier 3.5)** *Just the one is fine*
* **Internet Card** ***OR*** **Disk Drive** *We won't be covering the disk drive's required installation process, So probably better to stick with the Internet Card*
