# Setup

## Robot

Robots aren't found in NEI with any recipe.
They are made by placing an opencomputers `Computer Case` in an opencomputers `Electronics Assembler`

The Electronics Assembler can be powered by connecting to an ME system with AE2 Cable

Or use EU by connecting a **gt _CABLE_ or gt _WIRE_**. **NO TRANSFORMERS, BATTERY BUFFERS, OR ANYTHING ELSE!** although you might use want them upstream from assembler on the wire for actually providing power on the wire.

Yes the wire still needs power.

### Robot Component List
**Computer Case (Tier 3)** <-- Put this inside of the electronics Assembler. 

You now have this

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61132666-a367-43ae-9ffa-24f5641655b0)

* **Tier 3 Accelerated Processing Unit**
* **EEPROM (Lua Bios)**
* **Keyboard**
* **Screen (Tier 1)**
* **Redstone Card (Tier 2)**
* **Memory Module (Tier 3.5)** *Just the one is fine*
* **Internet Card**
* **Disk Drive**
* **ME Upgrade** ***THE BLUE ONE!!! - #3 - item code 10640:2***
* **Inventory Controller Upgrade**
* **2 x Inventory Upgrade**
* **Hard Disk Drive (Tier 1)**
* *Optionally - Linked Card* **If you do this, put the partner card somewhere safe, where you wont lose it. And rename it in an anvil.**
   - Only useful if you're planning on derping with any future systems. This robit is sufficient as a set and forget system as is.

Do what you want in the rest of the slots.. Including nothing. If you don't know what you want but think you want something... 

* Upgrade Container (Tier 3)
* Upgrade Container (Tier 2)


### Finishing Touches
**DOUBLE CHECK THAT YOU HAVE ALL COMPONENTS!** - ***If you have picked the wrong ME Upgrade, I will waste hours of your time***

**All _NECESSARY_ Components** are Included in the image below.

Click The Play button in the Electronics Assembler and Let It Craft! *This still takes a little while, so we'll come back for it, don't worry*

Now you need to obtain the following;
* **charger** <-- Of the OpenComputers variety
* **OpenOs (Operating System)**
* **ME Wireless Access Point**
* **Machine Controller Cover**
* **2x Red Alloy Wire**
* **lever** *or equivelant*

The only thing that is not shown in the pictures below is the cover. The cover goes on the top side of the block.

It can be placed in other locations.. but only if you know what you are doing.

> [!NOTE]
> The robot only outputs a signal strength of 1. This means that the color of the red alloy wire is **NOT** going to change while 'on'
