manually install programs by adding them to /usr/bin/

So..
```
mkdir /usr/bin
edit /usr/bin/getMethods.lua
```
and paste the code in using the opencomputers paste hotkey (configurable in minecrafts keybinds under the OpenComputers header)

Or whatever other method you prefer

The files in that particular directory, ending in .lua are executable in the command line from any directory. Otherwise put it wherever you want, called whatever you want, and execute it how you please =].
